    {A system for predicting a non-fraud dispute using an artificial intelligence (AI) based communications system is disclosed. The system may comprise a data access interface to receive instructions historical transaction and disputes data from at least one data source associated with an account issuer. The data access interface may also receive incoming transaction data associated with a transaction from at least one data source associated with an account holder. The system may comprise a processor to predict a likelihood of a non-fraud dispute associated with the transaction by: examining the historical transaction and disputes data; retrieving non-fraud dispute attributes; parsing the incoming transaction data; applying predictive analytics to the incoming transaction data to yield a prediction value; determining that the prediction value meets a predetermined threshold; and generating a predictio for the likelihood of a non-fraud dispute associated with the transaction associated with the account holder to be outputted, via an output interface to a user device.}
