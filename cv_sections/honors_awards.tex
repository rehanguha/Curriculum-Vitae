	{In this challenge, we use a drone to search for and locate a soil probe. The drone picks up the probe and takes it to a drop-off location. Then, the drone must autonomously return to a rover and land in its trunk. This was accomplished using Rtabmap, a SLAM package used to estimate the position and velocity states of the rover with visual odometry and our own tailor-made Kalman Filter conflated with GPS based state estimation and the visual odometry based states.}
