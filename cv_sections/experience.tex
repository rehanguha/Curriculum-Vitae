			\begin{itemize}
				\item Contributed an optimizer COCOB to Google TensorFlow SIG Addons 
				\item Worked on how to transform a wrapped page and de-wrap it 
				\item Researching on Gradient based Optimizers
			\end{itemize}
			\textbf{Client Projects}
			\begin{itemize}
				\item[] \textit{Healthy Paws}
				\item Role: Need to do a quality check for the scanned documents and write an algorithm to dewrap a scanned document
				\item We successfully developed an algorithm to check quality of the scanned document. We are in the process of developing an algorithm to dewrap an document.
				\item[] \textit{VERANA}
				\item Role: Managed the Data Science team of 2 including myself from Imaginea. Actively worked on their clinical dataset for increasing their coverage and accuracy for their existing scripts.
				\item We worked on some of their existing code and increased their accuracy and coverage percentage. We developed an address extraction script from a given document using NLP.
				\item[] \textit{BAIN}
				\item Role: Responsible for analyzing the CLV and building a Data Analytics dashboard.
				\item The project involves analyzing the survey data and figuring out the CLV. It also entails creating a Tableau Dashboard that analyzes all the features in a single dashboard.

			\textbf{Client Projects}
			\begin{itemize}
				\item[] \textit{RPX Corporation}
				\item Role: Handled Litigation Likelihood (LitLikelihood) module of the project â€“ from data analysis to production deployment.
				\item In this project, the data (~12M records) requires a lot of transformation where some major errors have been observed leading to a drastic improvement in the prediction accuracy. Therefore, LightGBM has been used here and the model is accepted by the client as well. Other projects under RPX, Imbalance Learning with Probabilistic Scoring with Binary Classification, LDA Topic Clustering.
